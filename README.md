Coral is [founderpad's](https://www.founderpad.com/) client facing application, which is used by founders alike to create and seek feedback from the community on their ideas.

## Getting Started

First, before you can clone the project, you must set up your SSH key in your GitHub settings. This is more secure than using HTTPS, and it alleviates the need to enter your credentials frequently.

Inside your working directory (e.g., $HOME/dev) run the following:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "{your-name}@founderpad.com"
```

Save it to the standard `id_rsa` file and then past the contents of it into your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) as a new SSH key. Once this is done you're good to go!
